# eeg_robot_arm_control
This project aims to develop a robotic arm controlled by EEG signals using 16-channel active dry electrodes. The design will be done with SolidWorks and simulated in MATLAB using Simulink and Simscape. The goal is to enable individuals with disabilities to regain mobility and improve their quality of life.
