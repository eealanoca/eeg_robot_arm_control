# EEG-Controlled Robotic Arm for Non-invasive Prosthetics

## Description

This project aims to develop a robotic arm controlled by EEG signals for non-invasive functional prosthetics. The robotic arm will be designed using SolidWorks, and the entire system will be simulated using MATLAB's Simulink and Simscape, allowing for a comprehensive validation process.

By leveraging 16-channel active dry electrodes, the robotic arm will be controlled using EEG signals. These signals will be processed and analyzed in MATLAB, utilizing advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The ultimate objective is to translate detected patterns of brain activity into precise control commands, enabling individuals with disabilities to operate the robotic arm through their brain signals.

The simulation of the complete system in Simulink will allow for real-time testing and evaluation, ensuring the accuracy and safety of the robotic arm's response to EEG-based control commands. The project will focus on ergonomic and functional design principles to provide a user-friendly interface and a wide range of movements for the robotic arm.

Contributions and collaborations from the robotics, neuroscience, and signal processing communities are highly encouraged. By working together, we can improve the field of non-invasive prosthetics and empower individuals with enhanced mobility and independence.
